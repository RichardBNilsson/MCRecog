# Installation Instructions
## These instructions assume you already know how to install and run mods

1. Make sure you have python installed:
 - Open commmand prompt in the location of the mcrecog.py file
 - Type 'python' (minus the quotes obviously)
 - If you already have python installed, it should bring you into a virtual environment in the command prompt. If you don't, it should open the Microsoft Store.
 - Install python from the Microsoft Store.
 2. Restart command prompt
 3. Type 'pip3 install SpeechRecognition'
 4. Type 'pip3 install pipwin'
 5. Type 'python3 -m pipwin install pyaudio'
 6. Launch Minecraft with the mod installed (It is important that Minecraft runs first)
 7. Once Minecraft has opened, type 'python3 mcrecog.py' into your command prompt
